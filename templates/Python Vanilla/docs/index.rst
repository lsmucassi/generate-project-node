Welcome to bootstrapy's documentation!
======================================

**bootstrapy** is a basic boilerplate python application that helps you bootstrap quickly. It takes the pain away from setting up documentation, packaging and deployment, so that you can simply focus on writing code and shipping it asap.

bootstrapy is **BSD licensed**, so feel free to use it as you like.
